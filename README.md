# ML Model Optimization Project 

##  Overview
This project builds and optimizes a Machine Learning model using the classic Iris dataset.
The main goal is to start with a baseline model, apply boosting techniques, and observe how performance improves through systematic model optimization.

It is designed to be simple, beginner-friendly, and professional enough for interviews and portfolio use.

##  Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 flower samples across 3 species:
-Setosa
-Versicolor
-Virginica

Each sample includes 4 numerical features:
-Sepal length
-Sepal width
-Petal length
-Petal width
This dataset is widely used for classification tasks because it is small, clean, and easy to visualize.

##  Project Objectives
✔ Build a baseline ML model
You begin with a simple classifier to understand performance without optimization.

✔ Apply performance-boosting techniques
These may include:
-Feature scaling
-Hyperparameter tuning
-Adding regularization
-Trying tree-based algorithms
-Experimenting with boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

✔ Compare baseline vs optimized models
You evaluate accuracy, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.

✔ Build a clean & reproducible ML workflow
This project follows a structure that makes your work professional and understandable for others.

##  What Techniques We Used
-Train–test split to check model generalization
-Baseline model (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)
-Boosted models (GradBoost / AdaBoost / XGBoost depending on your setup)
-Metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall)
-Visualization for results and model comparison
-Feature importance analysis (if using tree-based models)
